# BIDOME/Commander
Commander is a custom command framework built for [Harmony](https://github.com/harmonyland/harmony/) 
that provides interoperability between slash and text commands. 
Commander is designed with Bidome in mind and as such may lack features found in other frameworks
but it can stil be used in production bots and new features can be implemented as requested.
